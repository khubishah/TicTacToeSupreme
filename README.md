# TicTacToeSupreme
This project was an opportunity for me to learn the key design principles and design patterns of React.js.
An elite version of the simple game of Tic Tac Toe, built using React.JS.

Some cool extra features: move history tracker, move position tracker, timer, game rewinding.

Currently working on: adding Redux, TicTacToc AI (player against the computer... and always tie or lose!)
